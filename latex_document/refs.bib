But surely if market prices were often irrational and if market returns were as predictable as some critics have claimed, then professionally managed investment funds should easily be able to outdistance a passive index fund. This paper shows that professional investment managers, both in The U.S. and abroad, do not outperform their index benchmarks and provides evidence that by and large market prices do seem to reflect all available information.},

We employ a state-of-the-art panel data stationarity test which incorporates multiple structural breaks. Evidence indicates that when accommodating general forms of cross-sectional dependence as well as controlling for finite-sample bias, the real stock price series appear to be stationary in 32 developed and 26 developing countries, respectively, which is in sharp contrast to the findings in the existing literature. Thus, real stock price indices are stationary processes that are inconsistent with the efficient market hypothesis. This shows the presence of profitable arbitrage opportunities among stock markets. According to these estimated structural breakpoints, we are also able to discover the reason for why there has been a huge impact from past stock prices.}

  abstract = {Forecasting stock exchange rates is an important financial problem that is receiving increasing attention. During the last few years, a number of neural network models and hybrid models have been proposed for obtaining accurate prediction results, in an attempt to outperform the traditional linear and nonlinear approaches. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of neural network models which are known to be dynamic and effective in stock-market predictions. The models analysed are multi-layer perceptron (MLP), dynamic artificial neural network (DAN2) and the hybrid neural networks which use generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) to extract new input variables. The comparison for each model is done in two view points: Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Deviate (MAD) using real exchange daily rate values of NASDAQ Stock Exchange index.}

  abstract = {The financial market consists of various money-making strategies wherein trading through a stock market is an important example. The complex non-linear behaviors of volatile stock markets attract researchers to study inherent patterns. As the primary motivation for investment in such markets is to gain higher profits, potential stocks are given considerable attention using various weighting strategies that can enhance future returns. Term frequency‚Äìinverse document frequency (TF‚ÄìIDF) is a statistical approach with remarkable applications in the financial domain for information retrieval from textual data; it identifies the importance of a term in the given document of a corpus. However, the application of TF‚ÄìIDF for the numerical data representation is explored to a limited extent. In this article, we propose to extend the applicability of TF‚ÄìIDF for the numerical time-series stock market data; we process the data and prepare them to be suitable for TF‚ÄìIDF. We utilize this statistical approach to derive feature weight matrix from the historical stock market data and further, integrate it with the widely explored neural network architectures namely, backpropagation neural network (BPNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) for predicting stock market trend. Simulation results show that the proposed integrated approach using TF‚ÄìIDF-based feature weight matrix and neural networks outperforms the considered recent approaches. The results are statistically supported with p-value less than .01 using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test; our proposed approach is supported with illustrative examples to develop better understanding of the work. Also, remarks on the conclusions and potential future scope are discussed.}
