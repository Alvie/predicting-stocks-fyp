\section{Research method}
The research methodology is one based on the literature review (\autoref{chap:literature-review});
the research already carried out in other studies
informed the the decision making process behind the requirements of the supporting artefact. Various artificial
intelligence models have been analysed and critiqued; as well as the input features used within these models.

These aspects combined are used to inform the variables - such as model used, input features
(and their time horizons) - to experiment with to better understand which variables are most important
and have the ability to provide the most accurate results.
