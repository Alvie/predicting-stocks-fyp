Many people participate in stock markets with hopes to make a return on their investment. While it
is believed that in the long term, prices always trend upwards; there is debate regarding short term
price movements. Some believe it to not be possible to predict stock market index prices due to the
efficient market hypothesis. Different neural networks are evaluated to identify the optimal
research method for this task. This project looks into various different input features and lengths of
historical data as inputs to neural networks to select optimal features in order to attempt to predict
stock market index prices with accuracy. This project uses neural networks with a novel case study to
derive the selection of optimal features. The results are compared with a benchmark application to
evaluate its performance.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Firstly, I would like to thank my project supervisor, Dr Alexander Gegov for his continued support
throughout my project, and his advice on how best to proceed with this project.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my family members for their never-ending love,
support, and encouragements in both my personal and academic life.
Thank you Syed Mahmud, Popi Mahmud and Noshin Mahmud.

\appendix
\chapter{PID}
The scope of the project has changed since the PID due to a number of reasons. Primarily the project
type was adjusted from engineering to research and as a result the requirements of the project had changed.
The project had become more focused on answering research questions rather than building an artefact.
