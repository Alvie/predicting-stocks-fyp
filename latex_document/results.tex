\section{Accuracy of Iteration 1}
As mentioned in \autoref{ssec:iteration1layers}, various combinations of LSTM layers and Dense layers were tested,
each with various sizes. The results of all of the models can be seen in \autoref{fig:iteration1_train_accuracy}
and \autoref{fig:iteration1_all_accuracy}.\\
The results of the best model can be seen in \autoref{fig:iteration1_best_accuracy}

\subsection{Accuracies of all tests}
In the charts below, each line represents a combination of different layer types and sizes of the Dense and LSTM layers of the chart.
For both the training and validation accuracy charts, each line has a corresponding line in the loss charts with the same colour.
There are 16 lines in total for this iteration as there were 2 LSTM layer amounts, 2 Dense layer amounts,
2 LSTM layer sizes, and 2 Dense layer sizes in the tests.

There are varying degrees of success with different combinations of layers; some do not improve in accuracy and others do.
The validation losses using the sparse categorical loss function as described earlier in \autoref{ssec:iteration1_ai_model}
were used to help identify which models had the lowest error rate; and as an increasing validation
loss is an indicator of overfitting, it was used to filter models showing overfitting.

The best model found within this iteration was one with a two LSTM layers of size 64 followed
by the final Dense layer of size 2. The grey line represents the training set and the orange line represents
the validation set  The validation loss shows little overfitting as can be seen in
\autoref{fig:iteration1_best_loss}. At 31 epochs, the validation accuracy reaches its highest value of
55.54\% whilst the training accuracy reached above 57.18\%.
\subsection{Evaluation of iteration 1}
With a validation accuracy above 55\% it suggests that there is improvement above a random choice. It forms a good
basis for testing further AI models, specifically the CNN-LSTM hybrid model.
There are various limitations with regards to iteration 1. This iteration does not test various combinations of
input features nor does it test various sequence lengths. Furthermore, there could be another number of layers or
layer sizes that is better suited to the problem but unfortunately many have not been tested due to time constraints.

\section{Accuracy of iteration 2}
As mentioned in \autoref{ssec:iteration1layers}, various combinations of LSTM layers and Dense layers were tested,
each with various sizes. The results of all of the models can be seen in \autoref{fig:iteration1_train_accuracy}
and \autoref{fig:iteration1_all_accuracy}.\\
